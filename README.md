FNCE 5894 – Capstone
Selected Topics in Credit Risk Management
Fall 2017 - DETAILED COURSE OUTLINE
SUBJECT TO CHANGE
# 1.	Course Description

The objective of the classroom portion of the Capstone for 2017 is the application of computing techniques to selected topics in credit risk management. In this context, three specifics areas will be explored.  We begin with the analysis of credit exposure measurement and management as embodied by Potential Future Exposure (PFE), Expected Exposure (EE) and Expected Positive Exposure (EPE).  From there, we proceed to the pricing of credit risk hedging as manifested in CVA, the credit valuation adjustment.  Before concluding, we will review OIS discounting and wrong way risk.  Time permitting, we will examine credit risk mitigation in the energy markets, specifically as it relates a) to the financing of power plants, and b) to margin support for energy hedging strategies.  

Each topic will be explored via its mathematical finance underpinnings and by simulation methods that enable the robust calculation of complex credit risks.  The technologies of choice will be Excel-based prototyping and conversion to Python codes for rapid calculations and modular modifications.  Along the way, we will review some of the “greatest hits” of the past year, including the price of a swap, geometric Brownian motion, and the Black-Scholes formula, and introduce some other gems like the Margrabe formula.

# 7.	Additional Reading: (tentative)

1.	“Relevance of Risk Capital and Margining for the Valuation of Power Plants - Cash Requirements for Credit Risk Mitigation”, Joachim Lang and Reinhard Madlener, FCN Working Paper No. 1/2010, E.ON Energy Research Center, FCN | Institute for Future Energy Consumer Needs and Behavior.

# 8.	Supplemental Texts: 
These are books that provide additional in-depth coverage on the topics of interest to us.  They provide more material than we need for this abbreviated course.  The first covers CVA in depth, including an excellent chapter on (energy) commodity markets.  The second is a new book with excellent overall coverage of the trading issues in the energy markets.  I highly recommend both texts when you have the time, resources, and need for additional study in these areas.  They are on reserve in the library.
